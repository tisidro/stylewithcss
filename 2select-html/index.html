          Coral reefs are teeming with life. They are known as the
          <em>rainforests of the sea</em> with how many various species live
          within their waters. The defining feature of these ecosystems are the
          plant-like coral, which are really colonies of tiny invertebrates
          called <strong>polyps</strong>.

        <p>
          Sadly, many reefs around the world are in danger due to rising ocean
          temperatures, pollution, and overfishing.
