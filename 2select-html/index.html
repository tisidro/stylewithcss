        Coral reefs are teeming with life. They are known as the
        <em>rainforests of the sea</em> with how many various species live
        within their waters. The defining feature of these ecosystems are the
        plant-like coral, which are really colonies of tiny invertebrates called
        <strong>polyps</strong>.

        Sadly, many reefs around the world are in danger due to rising ocean
        temperatures, pollution, and overfishing.
