## How To Work with the Box Model in CSS.

## What I learned and how it applies in my Github page example:

I learned the **primary properties** of the box model: margin, padding, border, width, and height. I practiced using these properties and visualized their relationship to each other in the box model.

Next, I manipulated the **box-sizing property** to influence the box-model's behavior. The default state of the box-sizing property is the **content-box**.  The content-box adds the width or height plus padding and border properties to compute the width or height of the box. Thus, it can create a box larger than intended.

In box-sizing, use of the **border-box** is a good alternative because it does not add padding and border properties to width and height but rather subtracts them to compute the dimensions of the box.

Finally, I learned about the **universal selector a.k.a. the "star selector."** This one when used with the box-sizing property will effect all elements on the page, and thus can slow things down if there are many elements. Use it with care!
