## How To Use Color Values with CSS.

## What I learned and how it applies in my Github page example:

- Colors can be added to CSS with keywords describing the color (i.e. - red or maroon).

- Colors can also be added using hexadecimal values. These operate on a a base 16 valuation system that uses 0-9 as their numerical values and the letters a-f as values ranging from 10-15. 

- Hex values, which follow the # starting the hexadecimal control primary color intensity.

- For readability/accessibility, it's important to maintain a good color contrast between a background-color and the text color value.

- rgb() uses numeric only values ranging from 0 to 255 for each primary color channel, which is easier to understand. For example, by increasing the r value the color becomes warmer.

- You can easily convert hex to rgb() using online converter tools.

- hsl() uses a color from the color wheel with saturation and lightness levels and to generate a final color. 

- It uses 3 values like rgb(). These values represent hue, saturation, and lightness. It uses degrees to go around a color wheel starting at 0 (red) and goes around the rainbow from there until it reaches 360 degrees.

-An example of how this works: a 94% lightness value for light gray will be very light gray. An 80% value is darker, and so on.

- A hue value is set to 0 and the saturation is set to 100%, giving a full saturation red. Lightness will then adjust the lightness values of the red. At 50% lightness it becomes pink and goes up until it's white at 100% lightness.

- The advantage to using hsl() is that it's easier to put together a color scheme by deciding on a  a hue  value and saturation and setting other colors with varying degrees of lightness.

-Higher saturation makes a color more vibrant. 

- Hue is the degree marker that goes from 0 to 360 along the color wheel (red, yellow,  green, blue, etc.).

- There are color conversion tools to help convert from rgb() to hsl().
