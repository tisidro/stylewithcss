## How To Apply Background Styles to HTML Elements with CSS

- You can apply background colors and images to HTML elements.

- Take care with image names and paths when linking in CSS.

- Tiling images is easy with the background-repeat property.

- By default, background image repeats as a tiled pattern along x and y axis.

- You can control this with the background-repeat property.

- Placement of background images can be adjusted with the. Background-position property. You can set to center or bottom right, top left, etc. 

- You can also set the background-position to a numeric value like left 20% top 10px. 

- The left 20% anchors the background image 20% of the elementâ€™s width from the right from the left.

- The top 10px sets the background image  10px from the bottom of the element.

- The background-size property can be used for resizing a background-image in an element.

- You can set it to contain to contain the image within its element and cover will cover the bounds of the element.

- You can numerically set the background-size to a width and height. If you set 40% auto it sets the width to 40% of the element and height automatically adjusts. If there is just one value, it applies to both width and height.

- You can just use the background property and include values like background-image, position, color one after the other as shorthand.

- Similarly you can shorthand size but need to include a slash / before the size value.

- Linear gradients can also be given direction and stopping points applied to colors to adjust appearance and form interesting effects.

- Creating multiple backgrounds on one class is possible in the css by simply separating the backgrounds with a comma. This saves having to create multiple HTML classes and applying those backgrounds individually.
