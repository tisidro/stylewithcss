    <h1><strong>Terri's Example: Applying CSS to HTML With Cascade and Specificity</strong></h1>
    <div>
      My cat Tina is a <strong style="color: orange">pain</strong> when it comes
      to wanting her breakfast first thing in the morning!
      </div>
      <div> <strong class="highlight">Finny</strong>, our other cat, will wait
      patiently without meowing and <strong>scratching</strong> at the door.</div>
     
    
    <h2>What is demonstrated on this page:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the bold text is red because the "strong" style in the styles.css has a
        red color and I gave it an !important flag. That over-rides everything!
      </li>

      <li>
        If you comment out the strong style on line 12 of styles.css, then you
        get green text for the "Finny" text because it takes the "highlight"
        class color of green.
      </li>

      <li>
        "Pain" would then be orange because it has an inline style of orange for
        the strong tag.
      </li>

      <li>
        "Scratching" will just be blue because it has no class and would take
        the last color assigned to div tags in the styles.css file...which is
        blue!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
