    <h1><strong>Terri's Example: Applying CSS to HTML With Cascade and Specificity</strong></h1>
    <p class="main__paragraph">
      My cat Tina is a <strong style="color: orange">pain</strong> when it comes
      to wanting her breakfast first thing in the morning!
    </p>
      <div class="main__paragraph"> <strong class="highlight">Finny</strong>, our other cat, will wait
      patiently without meowing and <strong>scratching</strong> at the door.</div>
     
      <figure class="main__image">
        <img src="images/shark.jpg"
     alt="Cartoon depicting Sammy the Shark"
     title="Sammy the Shark">
    <figcaption>The original example in our lesson featured "Sammy the Shark!"</figcaption>
</figure>
    </div>
    <h2 class="main__title">What is demonstrated on this page:</h2>
    <div class="main__list">
    <ul class="main__ul">
      <li class="main__li">
        the bold text is red because the "strong" style in the styles.css has a
        red color and I gave it an !important flag. That over-rides everything!
      </li>

      <li class="main__li">
        If you comment out the strong style on line 12 of styles.css, then you
        get green text for the "Finny" text because it takes the "highlight"
        class color of green.
      </li>

      <li class="main__li">
        "Pain" would then be orange because it has an inline style of orange for
        the strong tag.
      </li>

      <li class="main__li">
        "Scratching" will just be blue because it has no class and would take
        the last color assigned to div tags in the styles.css file...which is
        blue!
      </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
