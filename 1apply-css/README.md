# [*Tutorial 1*](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity): How To Apply CSS Styles to HTML with Cascade and Specificity.

## What I learned and how it applies in my Github page example:

- I learned how to use the HTML style attribute inline, in the <head> and to link to an external CSS document.
- It is important to inspect the flow of the "CSS cascade" if my code is not working as expected.
-I can instruct the browser to pay more attention to a style by using higher specificity selectors, but only use the !important when all else fails!
