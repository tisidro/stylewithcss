## How To Style HTML Elements with Borders, Shadows, and Outlines in CSS

## What I learned and how it applies in my Github page example:
- The `border-property` applies a line in any color to the outer perimeter of a container. The properties for border are: thickness, style, and color.Â 
- You can specify individual sides that will have a border with the direction variations like `border-right`, etc.
- Border styles can create depth and define a container. Adding `border-color` works well for this.
- The way to define width and style is with `border`. Example: `border: 1px solid`.
- Borders can be further specified with combinations of these properties such as `border-right-color`.
- With `text-shadow` you can specify shadows on text content.
- The `box-shadow` property allows you to add shadows to elements and containers.
- You can apply an outline to a button with `.button:focus`. By default browsers outline buttons with a certain look so that when you tab to them they appear to be focused on with an outline.
- If you set the button `outline:none` on the button, it allows you to set more customized styles with the `.button:focus {}` selector.
